## Backend API Server

Backend API uses Python and Flask and connects to a MySQL and Neo4j DB on AWS.

### Directions:
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies (optional: do it in a virtual environment).

2. Create a `config.py` file that holds all the credentials for your MySQL and Neo4j databases

3. Run `main.py` to start server
