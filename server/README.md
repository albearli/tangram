## Backend API Server

Backend API uses Python and Flask and connects to a MySQL and Neo4j DB on AWS.

To use, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies (optional: do it in a virtual environment).

Create a `config.py` file that holds all the credentials for your MySQL and Neo4j databases

Run `main.py` to start server
